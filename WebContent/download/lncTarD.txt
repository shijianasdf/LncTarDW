Mechanistically, paraspeckle promotes IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation by binding and trapping peroxiredoxin-5 (PRDX5) mRNA in nucleus, decreasing protein level of PRDX5 which can directly interact with STAT3 and inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation.	29219178;30377567	RID00038	ceRNA or sponge

Here we found that H19 levels are remarkably increased in bladder cancer tissues, and upregulated H19 promotes bladder cancer cell migration in vitro and in vivo. H19 is associated with enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), and that this association results in Wnt/beta-catenin activation and subsequent downregulation of E-cadherin. A significant negative correlation is also observed between H19 levels and E-cad levels in vivo. These data suggest that upregulated H19 enhances bladder cancer metastasis by associating with EZH2 and inhibiting E-cad expression. Inhibition of E-cadherin expression by lnc-RNA H19 to facilitate bladder cancer metastasis;RNA interference is applied to knockdown H19 expression in bladder cancer cell, and found potentiated E-cadherin expression (p< 0.05), accompanied with weakened metastatic potency (p< 0.05)	23354591;29614625	RID00557	transcriptional regulation

As expected, CDDP inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. HOTAIR knockdown or miR-203a-3p overexpression increased the sensitivity of CRC cells to CDDP. We confirmed these results with another chemotherapy drug, PTX. HOTAIR knockdown and miR-203a-3p overexpression increased the sensitivity of CRC cells to PTX.Therefore, these data suggested that HOTAIR could enhance the drug resistance of CRC cells.HOTAIR suppressed the expression of miR-203a-3p, thus inducing Wnt/beta-catenin signaling activation and CRC cell proliferation and chemoresistance enhancements.HOTAIR promotes the proliferation and chemoresistance of CRC cells through targeting miR-203a-3p-Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.	29680837	RID00579	ceRNA or sponge

The results of the present study demonstrated that the expression of FAF1 was upregulated in patients with disc bulging, herniation and IDD, and the expression of FAF1 was positively correlated with the grade of disc degeneration according to the patients' Pfirrmann score. The expression of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), a possible target of FAF1, was consistent with the expression of FAF1. In addition, it was elucidated that inactivation of the Erk signaling pathway by PD98059 reversed the effect of FAF1 on NP cell proliferation. Taken together, these results demonstrated that FAF1 was vital in the proliferation of NP cells by modulating the Erk signaling pathway, which suggests that FAF1 may be a novel marker in the early diagnosis of IDD and a therapeutic target for patients.	29257270	RID00857	expression association

The target of WDR7-7, G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 30 (GPR30, formerly known as GPER), was present in both ER+ and ER- breast cancer cells, as confirmed by a luciferase reporter assay. we demonstrate that the expression of WDR7-7 is reduced in breast cancer cell lines and that the overexpression of WDR7-7 inhibits growth through a mechanism that involves G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 30 (GPR30).in all four GPR30-positive breast cancer lines, calycosin decreased the phosphorylation levels of SRC, EGFR, ERK1/2 and Akt, but the inhibition of WDR7-7 blocked these changes and increased proliferation. These results suggest the possibility that calycosin inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells, at least partially, through WDR7-7-GPR30 signaling, which may explain why calycosin can exert inhibitory effects on ER- breast cancer.	29096683	RID01113	expression association

The results showed that lncCAMTA1 expression promoted cell viability and migration/invasion, while knockdown of lncCAMTA1 promoted cell apoptosis via binding with miR-20b. lncCAMTA1 negatively regulated miR-20b expression. VEGF was a target of miR-20b, leading to the modification of the phosphorylation levels of MAPK, ERK, JAK, STAT1, and STAT3. Our findings suggested that lncCAMTA1 might promote proliferation and mobility of human breast cancer cells via binding with miR-20b. VEGF was a direct target of miR-20b and regulated activation of the MAPK/ERK and JAK/STAT3 signaling pathways. Therefore lncCAMTA1 has potential as a novel cancer diagnostic marker and as a putative novel therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment.	28550685	RID01179	ceRNA or sponge

Interestingly, we found that MALAT1 regulated radioresistance by modulating cancer stem cell (CSC) activity. Furthermore, we found that there was reciprocal repression between MALAT1 and miR-1, and slug was identified as a downstream target of miR-1. Taking these observations into consideration, we proposed that MALAT1 regulated CSC activity and radioresistance by modulating miR-1/slug axis, which indicated that MALAT1 could act as a therapeutic target for NPC patients.	26482776	RID01275	ceRNA or sponge

These data suggest that the Skp2 may be regulated by Meg3 at post-transcriptional level. Bioinformatics analyses showed that miR-3163 bound to 3'-UTR of Skp2 mRNA in NSCLC cells to inhibit its translation, which was supported by luciferase reporter assay. Meg3 augmented the effects of miR-3163 on Skp2 mRNA, possibly through binding-induced function enhancement, which was supported by the double fluorescent in situ hybridization showing co-localized intracellular Meg3 and miR-3163 signals in NSCLC cells. Thus, our data suggest that Meg3 and miR-3163 may coordinate suppression of translation of Skp2 mRNA in NSCLC cells to inhibit NSCLC cell growth.	26482610	RID01276	ceRNA or sponge

Strikingly, the overexpression of H19 increases the binding of TERT to TERC and reduces the interplay between TERT with TERRA, thus enhancing the cell telomerase activity and extending the telomere length. On the other hand, insulator CTCF recruits the CUDR-CCND1 complx to form the composite CUDR-CCND1-insulator CTCF complex which occupancied on the C-myc gene promoter region, increasing the outcome of oncogene C-myc. Ultimately, excessive TERT and C-myc lead to liver cancer stem cell and hepatocyte-like stem cell malignant proliferation.	26513297	RID01295	transcriptional regulation

Interestingly, GAS5 could also repress miR-222 expression. A pulldown assay further validated that GAS5 could directly bind to miR-222. As a competing endogenous RNAs, GAS5 had no effect on primary miR-222 expression. In addition, GAS5 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm. Quantitative RT-PCR further demonstrated that the copy numbers of GAS5 per cell are higher than those of miR-222. GAS5 increased the level of p27 protein by functioning as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-222, thereby inhibiting the activation and proliferation of HSCs.	26446789	RID01296	ceRNA or sponge

SIRT1-AS overexpression promoted the proliferation of the human HCC cell lines by upregulating the SIRT1 protein level. The mechanism was that SIRT1-AS bound to SIRT1 mRNA at 3'UTR, masked the miR-29c binding site and stabilized SIRT1 mRNA. A single-nucleotide mutation (622U>C) in the SIRT1-AS sequence was found when we used gene sequencing as an assistant approach for HCC diagnosis. Bioinformatics and the RNase protection assay revealed that the mutation led to a marked alteration in the secondary structure of SIRT1-AS and caused its inability to bind with SIRT1 mRNA. The results of the present study suggest that the 622C mutant of SIRT1 antisense transcript suppresses HCC cell line proliferation, decreases the risk of HCC and is a potential target for gene therapy.	26324025	RID01302	interact with mRNA

We report here that miR-26a and lncRNA MEG3 gene expression were both strongly reduced in TSCC compared with levels in matched nonmalignant tissues, and combined low expression levels of both miR-26a and MEG3 emerged as an independent prognostic factor for poor clinical outcome in TSCC patients. Assays in the human TSCC cell lines SCC-15 and CAL27 showed that miR-26a targets the DNA methyltransferase 3B transcript and that its inhibition may result in the upregulation of MEG3, providing a plausible link between the observed reduction of miR-26a and MEG3 in TSCC tissue. Furthermore, the overexpression of miR-26a or MEG3 in SCC-15 and CAL27 cells inhibited cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, and promoted cell apoptosis.It could therefore be of interest to investigate a possible link between miR-148a and MEG3 expression in ovarian cancer. In addition, miR-26a and MEG3 expression were correlated in TSCC (Tongue Squamous Cell Carcinoma) cells and it has been postulated that this relationship depends on the ability of miR-26a to target DNMT3B in this model and thus prevent meg3 promoter methylation	25537514;24343426	RID01322	epigenetic regulation

Luciferase reporter assay revealed a direct interaction between the 2 miRNAs and MALAT1, respectively, via a putative binding site within MALAT1. Meanwhile,both the 2 miRNAs could bind to HMGB1 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) and regulate HMGB1 expression. Moreover, knockdown of MALAT1 decreased HMGB1 expression, inhibited OS cell growth and promoted apoptosis, while miR-142-3p and miR-129-5p inhibitor partly restored the inhibitory effect of MALAT1 knockdown on HMGB1 expression, OS cell growth and the promotion of apoptosis.	28346809	RID01390	ceRNA or sponge

Here, we report that the lncRNA FER1L4 (fer-1-like family member 4, pseudogene) acts as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to regulate the expression of PTEN (a well-known tumor suppressor gene) by taking up miR-106a-5p in gastric cancer. More importantly, FER1L4 downregulation accelerated cell proliferation by promoting the G0/G1 to S phase transition. We conclude that one mechanism by which lncRNAs function in in tumorigenesis is as ceRNAs for tumor suppressor mRNAs.	27381864	RID01482	ceRNA or sponge

Here, we identify the host transcript of miR-223, linc-223, as a novel functional long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in AML. We also demonstrate that endogenous linc-223 localizes in the cytoplasm and acts as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-125-5p, an oncogenic microRNA in leukemia. Among the validated miR-125-5p target mRNAs, we focused on the transcription factor IRF4 (interferon regulatory factor 4).In particular, we show that linc-223 directly binds to miR-125-5p and that its knockdown increases the repressing activity of miR-125-5p resulting in the downregulation of its target interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), which it was previously shown to inhibit the oncogenic activity of miR-125-5p in vivo.Therein, these findings indicate that the newly identified lncRNA linc-223 may have an important role in myeloid differentiation and leukemogenesis, at least in part, by cross-talking with IRF4 mRNA.	27517498	RID01486	ceRNA or sponge

We further found that the expression and function of miR-183 were suppressed by MALAT1. Integrin beta1 (ITGB1) was then speculated and confirmed as a direct target of miR-183. We also illustrated that MALAT1 may function as a sponge competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-183, and thus regulate the molecular expression of ITGB1. Collectively, we found a new signaling pathway promoting melanoma development by MALAT1-miR-183-ITGB1 axis, which may be clinically valuable as new targets for malignant melanoma therapy.	27966454	RID01508	ceRNA or sponge

Three chemotherapy drugs [Cisplatin (DDP; Shandong, China), Adriamycin (ADM; Jiangsu, China) Etoposide (VP-16; Jiangsu, China),] were used. Furthermore, we conducted ChIP assays and found that knockdown of TUG1 decreased the binding of EZH2 and H3K27me3 levels across the LIMK2b promoter compared to cells transfected with siNC (Fig. 6f). Taken together, these data suggest that TUG1 is required to target EZH2 occupancy and activity to epigenetically modulate the expression of LIMK2b.	28069000	RID01509	epigenetic regulation

Collectively, the data demonstrate that Huaier extract reduces viability and induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells via H19-miR-675-5p-CBL axis regulation.H19 non coding RNA-derived miR-675 enhances tumorigenesis and metastasis of breast cancer cells by downregulating c-Cbl and Cbl-b. We showed that overexpression of H19/miR-675 enhanced the aggressive phenotype of breast cancer cells including increased cell proliferation and migration in vitro, and increased tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Moreover, we identified ubiquitin ligase E3 family (c-Cbl and Cbl-b) as direct targets of miR-675 in breast cancer cells. Using a luciferase assay, we demonstrated that H19, through its microRNA, decreased both c-Cbl and Cbl-b expression in all breast cancer cell lines tested. In addition, H19 is also a precursor for microRNA-675 (miR-675) and generates two mature miRNAs, miR-675-5p (miR-675) and miR-675-3p (miR-675*)	29145193	RID01522	expression association

UCA1, as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA), regulates mitochondrial function through upregulating ARL2. ARL2 is a direct target of miR-195 and can be repressed by either miR-195 overexpression or UCA1 inhibition. Animal experiments further indicated that UCA1 promoted bladder tumor growth by regulating miR-195 /ARL2.

Moreover, the UPF1-mediated inhibition of gastric cancer progression was reversed by overexpression of MALAT1. A profound downregulation of UPF1 in gastric tumor tissues was due to promoter hypermethylation. Overexpression of UPF1 increased nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) efficiency and thus led to downregulation of MALAT1.	28942451	RID01526	interact with protein

The long non-coding RNA, HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) was up-regulated in both pancreatic cancer tissues and cancer cell lines, and HOTAIR suppressed the expression of miR-613 via functioning as a competing endogenous RNA. In vivo studies showed that stable overexpression of miR-613 or knock-down of HOTAIR suppressed tumor growth and also reduced the expression of notch3. In conclusion, these results suggest that HOTAIR functions as a competing endogenous RNA to regulate notch3 expression via sponging miR-613 in pancreatic cancer.	28415631	RID01595	ceRNA or sponge

In this study, we found that RNA-binding protein 24 (RBM24) was frequently downregulated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Similarly, ectopic miR-25 expression suppressed NPC cellular growth and motility by targeting the pro-oncogenic lncRNA MALAT1, and the knockdown of MALAT1 expression exhibited similar effects as RBM24 restoration in NPC cells. Overall, these findings suggest a novel role of RBM24 as a tumor suppressor.

Interestingly, EGF rapidly downregulates LIMT expression by enhancing histone deacetylation at the respective promoter.We also find that LIMT inhibits extracellular matrix invasion of mammary cells in vitro and tumor metastasis in vivo.

There was a direct interaction between MIR376A and MALAT1 via a putative MIR376A binding site within the MALAT1 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR). There was also a direct interaction between MIR376A and the TGFA 3'-UTR. Thus, MALAT1 may promote OS cell growth through inhibition of MIR376A, leading to increased expression of TGFA. Our results suggest a MALAT1/MIR376A/TGFA axis mediates OS cell proliferation and tumor progression.	27458156	RID01647	ceRNA or sponge

GAS5 suppresses cancer proliferation by acting as a molecular sponge for miR-21, leading to the de-repression of phosphatase and tensin homologs (PTEN), the endogenous target of miR-21. Moreover, mTOR activation associated with reduced GAS5 expression was required to suppress PTEN. This work identifies GAS5 as a novel prognostic marker and candidate drug target for HER2-positive breast cancer.	27034004	RID01703	ceRNA or sponge

We found that MALAT1 interacts with both SRPK1 and SRSF1. MALAT1 increases AKAP-9 expression by promoting SRPK1-catalyzed SRSF1 phosphorylation.These findings suggest MALAT1 increases AKAP-9 expression by promoting SRPK1-catalyzed SRSF1 phosphorylation in CRC cells.Following MALAT1 knockdown, overexpression of SRPK1 was sufficient to restore SRSF1 phosphorylation and AKAP-9 expression to a level that promoted cell proliferation, invasion and migration in vitro.MALAT1 promotes colorectal cancer cell proliferation/migration/invasion via PRKA kinase anchor protein 9. overexpression of MALAT1 via RNA activation promoted CRC cell proliferation, invasion and migration in vitro, and stimulated tumor growth and metastasis in mice in vivo. Among these genes, PRKA kinase anchor protein 9 (AKAP-9) was significantly up-regulated at both mRNA and protein levels. Importantly, knockdown of AKAP-9 blocked MALAT1-mediated CRC cell proliferation, migration and invasion.

There was a positive correlation between FEZF1-AS1 and FEZF1 expression in CRC. Moreover, FEZF1 knockdown also significantly suppressed CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.

Interestingly, miR-490 can also repress CCAT1 expression. CCAT1 expression was significantly upregulated, and miR-490 expression was downregulated in GC. The negative correlation between miR-490 and CCAT1 expression was observed in GC tissues. Importantly, CCAT1 contains a putative miR-490-binding site, and deletion of this binding site abolishes their miR-490 responsiveness. Post-transcriptional CCAT1 silencing by miR-490 significantly suppressed GC cell migration. Furthermore, miR-490 directly bound to the hnRNPA1 mRNA 3'-UTR to repress its translation.	26825578	RID01762	ceRNA or sponge

Additionally, overexpression of beta-catenin resulted in an increase in KCNQ1OT1 lncRNA-coated territory. On the other hand, knockdown of beta-catenin resulted in significant decrease of KCNQ1OT1 lncRNA-coated territory and an increase in the mRNA expression of the SLC22A18 and PHLDA2 genes that are regulated by KCNQ1OT1. We showed that beta-catenin can promote KCNQ1OT1 transcription through direct binding to the KCNQ1OT1 promoter. Our evidence indicates that beta-catenin signaling may contribute to development of colorectal cancer by functioning as a novel lncRNA regulatory factor via direct targeting of KCNQ1OT1.	26868975	RID01776	transcriptional regulation

Moreover, over-expressed miR-326 reduced the FGF1 expression which played an oncogenic role in glioma by activating PI3K/AKT and MEK 1/2 pathways. In addition, the in vivo studies also supported the above findings. Taken together, knockdown of HOTAIR up-regulated miR-326 expression, and further inducing the decreased expression of FGF1, these results provided a comprehensive analysis of HOTAIR-miR-326-FGF1 axis in human glioma and provided a new potential therapeutic strategy for glioma treatment.These results suggested that FGF1 was a direct target of miR-326.	26183397	RID01814	ceRNA or sponge

Furthermore, Knockdown of TUG1 also down-regulated Heat shock transcription factor 2 (HSF2), a transcription factor of the heat shock transcription factor family, which was defined as a direct and functional downstream target of miR-144. HSF2 up-regulated the promoter activities and interacted with the promoters of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5 in GECs. In conclusion, our results indicate that knockdown of TUG1 increased BTB permeability via binding to miR-144 and then reducing EC tight junction protein expression by targeting HSF2. Thus, TUG1 may represent a useful future therapeutic target for enhancing BTB permeability.	26078353	RID01817	ceRNA or sponge

Importantly, there is a putative miR-21-binding site in exon 4 of GAS5; deletion of the miR-21-binding site abolishes this activity.We further show that the biotin-labeled GAS5-RNA probe is able to pull down the key component (AGO2) of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and we subsequently identify miR-21 in this GAS5-RISC complex, implying that miR-21 and GAS5 may regulate each other in a way similar to the microRNA-mediated silencing of target mRNAs.

Through deletion analysis, we identify an active region responsible for tumor cell growth inhibition within exon 4, which harbors two miR-211 binding sites. Importantly, this loc285194-mediated growth inhibition is in part due to specific suppression of miR-211. Together, these results suggest that loc285194 is a p53-regulated tumor suppressor, which acts in part through repression of miR-211.	23558749	RID01840	ceRNA or sponge

More importantly, YAP protein was critical for RMRP transcription by association to the proximal site near the transcription start site of the RMRP gene, a Pol III promoter, along with beta-catenin and TBX5 proteins. We propose that the interplay of Wnt and Hippo signaling pathways could regulate target genes, coding or non-coding, by the beta-catenin/YAP/TBX5 transcription complex in cancer cells.Association of beta-catenin and YAP to the RMRP promoter in conjunction with DNA binding proteins, TCF and TBX5, lead to the enhanced expression of RMRP.	26415221	RID01874	transcriptional regulation

Finally, we show that down-regulation of Aurora kinases A (AURKA) and B and chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 1 (CDT1) may explain the reduction in cellular proliferation observed on MINCR knockdown. We, therefore, suggest that MINCR is a newly identified player in the MYC transcriptional network able to control the expression of cell cycle genes.	26351698	RID01885	expression association

On the other hand, excessive CUDR triggers hepatocyte-like cells malignant transformation. Mechanistically, we identify CUDR causes highly upregulated in liver cancer (HULC) and beta-catenin abnormal expression by inhibiting HULC promoter methylation and promoting beta-catenin promoter-enhancer chromatin looping formation mediated by CUDR-ccctc-binding factor (CTCF) complex, which recruits more RNA polII and P300.

The action of GAS5 may be mediated by upregulation of P21 and suppression of CDK6.Decreased expression of long noncoding RNA GAS5 indicates a poor prognosis and promotes cell proliferation in gastric cancer. we found that GAS5 could influence gastric cancer cells proliferation, partly via regulating E2F1 and P21 expression. lncRNA GAS5 enhances G1 cell cycle arrest via binding to YBX1 to regulate p21 expression in stomach cancer. In this study, we found that lncRNA GAS5 had lower expression in stomach cancer tissues than the normal counterparts. lncRNA GAS5 was shown to interact with Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1), and lncRNA GAS5 knockdown was shown to accelerate YBX1 protein turnover without affecting YBX1 transcription. lncRNA GAS5 down-regulation reduced the YBX1 protein level, which decreased YBX1-transactivated p21 expression and abolished G1 phase cell cycle arrest in stomach cancer. These results delineate a novel mechanism of lncRNA GAS5 in suppressing stomach carcinogenesis, and the lncRNA GAS5/YBX1/p21 pathway we discovered may provide useful targets for developing lncRNA-based therapies for stomach cancer.	26278580;25959498;24884417	RID01903	expression association

Treatment of GBM cells with the BET bromdomain inhibitor I-BET151 reduced levels of the tumor-promoting lncRNA HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) and restored the expression of several other GBM down-regulated lncRNAs. Conversely, overexpression of HOTAIR in conjunction with I-BET151 treatment abrogates the antiproliferative activity of the BET bromodomain inhibitor. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated binding of Bromodomain Containing 4 (BRD4) to the HOTAIR promoter, suggesting that BET proteins can directly regulate lncRNA expression. Our data unravel a previously unappreciated mechanism through which BET proteins control tumor growth of glioblastoma cells and suggest that modulation of lncRNA networks may, in part, mediate the antiproliferative effects of many epigenetic inhibitors currently in clinical trials for cancer and other diseases.	26111795	RID01920	transcriptional regulation

We found that ZEB1-AS1 is frequently upregulated in HCC samples, especially in metastatic tumor tissues. DNA methylation analysis shows a tumor-specific ZEB1-AS1 promoter hypomethylation. Aberrant methylation is tightly correlated with overexpression of ZEB1-AS1 in HCC. Patients with ZEB1-AS1 hypomethylation or with high ZEB1-AS1 expression have poor recurrence-free survival. Functionally, ZEB1-AS1 promotes tumor growth and metastasis, acts as an oncogene in HCC. The ZEB1-AS1 gene is located in physical contiguity with ZEB1 and positively regulates the ZEB1 expression. ZEB1 inhibition partially abrogates ZEB1-AS1-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer metastasis. Our results provide novel insights into the function of lncRNA-driven hepatocarcinogenesis, highlight the important role of ZEB1-AS1 and ZEB1 in HCC progression, and indicate that ZEB1-AS1 may be served as a valuable prognostic biomarker for HCC.	26073087	RID01921	expression association

We identified lncRNA RGMB-AS1 was upregulated and RGMB was downregulated in NSCLC patients. Both were related to differentiation status, lymph node metastases and TNM stage. Studies also indicated that lncRNA RGMB-AS1 and RGMB were inversely correlated.	26055877	RID01928	expression association

We further demonstrate that miR-103/107 target FADD directly. Knockdown of miR-103/107 antagonizes necrosis in the cellular model and also myocardial infarction in a mouse ischemia/reperfusion model. The miR-103/107-FADD pathway does not participate in tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced necrosis. In exploring the molecular mechanism by which miR-103/107 are regulated, we show that long noncoding RNA H19 directly binds to miR-103/107 and regulates FADD expression and necrosis.Our results reveal a novel myocardial necrosis regulation model, which is composed of H19, miR-103/107, and FADD. Modulation of their levels may provide a new approach for preventing myocardial necrosis.	26038570	RID01930	ceRNA or sponge

These results delineate a novel mechanism of lncRNA GAS5 in suppressing stomach carcinogenesis, and the lncRNA GAS5/YBX1/p21 pathway we discovered may provide useful targets for developing lncRNA-based therapies for stomach cancer.	25959498	RID01936	interact with protein

The underlying mechanisms may involve in increased expression of self-renewal related factors Sox2. Collectively, we for the first time found the potential effects of MALAT-1 on the stem cell-like phenotypes in pancreatic cancer cells, suggesting a novel role of MALAT-1 in tumor stemness, which remains to be fully elucidated.	25811929	RID01953	expression association

RNA pull-down experiment revealed a direct bind of lncRNA-GAS5 to a Ca2+-dependent RNA-binding protein, Annexin A2. Further experiments showed that silencing of Annexin A2 reduced the HSVSMCs proliferation and vice versa. In the context of lncRNA-GAS5 knockdown, silencing of Annexin A2 reduced the proliferation of HSVSMCs while overexpression of Annexin A2 increased the proliferation. Thus, the low expression of lncRNA-GAS5 may facilitate HSVSMCs proliferation and migration through Annexin A2 and thereby the pathogenesis of GSV varicosities.	25806802	RID01956	interact with protein

Therefore, a tumor-suppressor long noncoding RNA (MEG3) and suppressed protooncogene (c-MET) combination could elicit menin's tumor-suppressor activity. Interestingly, MEG3 and c-MET expression was also altered in human sporadic insulinomas (insulin secreting PNETs) with hypermethylation at the MEG3 promoter CRE-site coinciding with reduced MEG3 expression.Furthermore, in MIN6 mouse insulinoma cells, DNA-demethylating drugs blocked cell proliferation and activated Meg3 expression.

In this study, we found that EZH2 (predominant PRC2 complex component) inhibition blocked cell cycle progression in glioma cells, consistent with the effects elicited by HOTAIR siRNA. However, the inhibition of LSD1 did not affect cell cycle progression in glioma cells. These results suggest that HOTAIR might regulate cell cycle progression through EZH2.In conclusion, HOTAIR promotes cell cycle progression in glioma as a result of the binding of its 5' domain to the PRC2 complex.Magnetofection based on superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle-mediated low lncRNA HOTAIR expression decreases the proliferation and invasion of glioma stem cells.CD133+ human glioma stem cells express a high level of HOTAIR. An in-depth mechanistic analysis showed that downregulation of HOTAIR expression reduced the recruitment of downstream molecules, EZH2 and LSD1, thereby activating the expression of PDCD4 at the transcriptional level. In conclusion, downregulation of HOTAIR expression effectively promoted the expression of PDCD4, thereby inhibiting the proliferation, invasion and in vivo tumorigenicity of human GSCs.	25428914;27277755	RID01996	interact with protein

The PCAT-1-cMyc relationship is mediated through the post-transcriptional activity of the MYC 3' untranslated region, and we characterize a role for PCAT-1 in the disruption of MYC-targeting microRNAs. To further elucidate a role for post-transcriptional regulation, we demonstrate that targeting PCAT-1 with miR-3667-3p, which does not target MYC, is able to reverse the stabilization of cMyc by PCAT-1. This work establishes a basis for the oncogenic role of PCAT-1 in cancer cell proliferation and is the first study to implicate lncRNAs in the regulation of cMyc in prostate cancer.	25425964	RID01998	expression association

In our profiling study, HOTTIP was identified as the most significantly up-regulated lncRNA in human HCCs, even in early stage of HCC formation. Functionally, knock-down of HOTTIP attenuated HCC cell proliferation in vitro and markedly abrogated tumourigenicity in vivo. HOTTIP is an antisense lncRNA mapped to the distal end of the HOXA gene cluster. Knock-down of HOTTIP significantly suppressed the expression of a number of HOXA genes.Furthermore, we identified miR-125b as a post-transcriptional regulator of HOTTIP. Ectopic expression of miR-125b reduced HOTTIP-coupled luciferase activity and suppressed the endogenous level of HOTTIP. Moreover, in human HCCs, HOTTIP expression negatively correlated with that of miR-125b.HOTTIP is a novel oncogenic lncRNA, which negatively regulated by miR-125b. Overexpression of HOTTIP contributes to hepatocarcinogenesis by regulating the expression of its neighbouring protein-coding genes.	25424744	RID01999	ceRNA or sponge

In this study, we for the first time demonstrated that treatment with antitumor reagents such as oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and pirarubicin (THP) dramatically induced HULC expression and protective autophagy. Silencing of HULC sensitized HCC cells to the three antitumor reagents via inhibiting protective autophagy.Ectopic expression of HULC elicited the autophagy of HCC cells through stabilizing silent information regulator 1 (Sirt1) protein. The investigation for the corresponding mechanism by which HULC stabilized Sirt1 revealed that HULC upregulated ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 (USP22), leading to the decrease of ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Sirt1 protein by removing the conjugated polyubiquitin chains from Sirt1.	28166203	RID02028	expression association

In this study, we found that the CRNDE expression level, in MM samples and cell lines, is higher than that in the control detected by real-time qPCR, which is also closely related to tumor progression and poor survival in MM patients. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase assay reveal the interaction by complementary bonding between CRNDE and miR-451. Pearson's correlation shows that CRNDE is negatively correlated to miR-451 expression in human MM samples. Our study illustrates that lncRNA CRNDE induces the proliferation and antiapoptosis capability of MM by acting as a ceRNA or molecular sponge via negatively targeting miR-451, which could act as a novel diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for MM.	28276319	RID02036	ceRNA or sponge

Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that NKILA was expressed at low levels in human melanoma tissues. Furthermore, qRT-PCR showed that NF-kB, which was negatively correlated with NKILA, was highly expressed in human melanoma tissues. Moreover, our results indicated that NKILA inhibited the carcinogenesis of melanoma cells through the inhibition of NF-kB in vitro. More importantly, we found that NKILA suppressed the growth of melanoma tumors via NF-kB in vivo. In conclusion, NKILA suppressed the development of malignant melanoma via the regulation of NF-kB and may be a potential therapeutic target in patients with melanoma.	28123845	RID02068	expression association

In our research, lncRNA-MALAT1 was specifically upregulated in HCCA tissues and cell lines, and was associated with pathological T stage, a larger tumor size, and perineural invasion.In addition, chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) was involved in MALAT1 induced human HCCA growth, migration, and invasion. By using online tools and a series of mechanistic analysis, we also demonstrated that miR-204-dependent CXCR4 regulation was required in MALAT1 modulating HCCA cell growth, migration and invasion. Taken together, our data indicated that MALAT1 might play an oncogenic role in HCCA through miR-204-dependent CXCR4 regulation, and could be regarded as a therapeutic target in HCCA.	28059437	RID02093	ceRNA or sponge

LncRNA H19 attenuated cell apoptosis in response to PTX treatment by inhibiting transcription of pro-apoptotic genes BIK and NOXA.

Treatment of these cells with palbociclib also decreased the expression of pRb-regulated DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), while conversely, knockdown of DNMT1 resulted in increased expression of MEG3. As gene methylation has been suggested for MEG3 regulation, we found that palbociclib resulted in decreased methylation of the MEG3 locus similar to that observed with 5-aza-deoxycytidine.while analysis of the TCGA database revealed decreased MEG3 expression in human lung tumors harboring a disrupted RB pathway.

We have previously identified a new lncRNA at the H19/IGF2 locus transcribed in H19 antisense orientation and named 91H. By using 91H-knockdown breast cancer cells, we demonstrated that 91H exerts oncogenic properties by promoting cell growth, migration and invasion as well as tumor growth in xenografted immunodeficient mouse model. Here, we observed that 91H, H19 and IGF2 are overexpressed in breast tumors. Moreover, 91H-knockdown reduces the expression of H19 and IGF2 in breast cancer cells. By chromatin-immunoprecipitation and methylation studies, we found that 91H expression prevents histone and DNA methylation on the maternal allele at the H19/IGF2 locus. These results indicate that 91H, through epigenetic modifications, is responsible of the maintenance of H19/IGF2 genomic imprinting allowing the allele-specific expression of H19 and IGF2. Taken together, overexpression of 91H in breast cancer and 91H-induced epigenetic modifications on H19/IGF2 locus suggest that 91H may play essential role in breast cancer development.	27780718	RID02134	epigenetic regulation

It antagonized chemosensitivity through acting as a competing endogenous RNA to modulate the expression of miR-193a-3p, and then erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4). Consistent with above findings, the specific AKT signaling inhibitor and activator were used, respectively, which demonstrated that Linc00152 contributed to L-OHP resistance at least partly through activating AKT pathway. Collectively, our findings established Linc00152 as a candidate prognostic indicator of outcome and drug responsiveness in colon cancer patients, and the involvement of competing endogenous RNAs mechanism in Linc00152/miR-193a-3p/ERBB4/AKT signaling axis may provide a novel choice in the investigation of drug resistance.Previous reports suggest that miR-193a-3p suppresses tumor proliferation, invasion, and metastasis by directly targeting and downregulating the expression of ERBB4.	27633443	RID02153	ceRNA or sponge

HOTTIP was aberrantly down-regulated in glioma tissues and glioma cell lines (U87-MG, U118-MG, U251 and A172), and over-expression of HOTTIP inhibited the growth of glioma cell lines in vitro and in vivo.Furthermore, HOTTIP could directly bind to the brain and reproductive expression (BRE) gene and down-regulate BRE gene expression. over-expression of HOTTIP significantly suppressed the expression of the cyclin A and CDK2 proteins and increased the expression of the P53 protein. these findings suggested that high levels of HOTTIP reduced glioma cell growth. Our studies demonstrated that over-expression of HOTTIP promotes cell apoptosis and inhibits cell growth in U118-MG and U87-MG human glioma cell lines by down-regulating BRE expression to regulate the expression of P53, CDK2 and Cyclin A proteins.	27733185	RID02154	interact with mRNA

We demonstrated H19 was overexpressed and negatively correlated with miR-342-3p in GBC. Furthermore, transwell invasion assays and cell cycle assays indicated that H19 knockdown inhibited both cells invasion and proliferation, but this effects was attenuated by co-transfection of siRNA-H19 and miR-342-3p inhibitor in GBC cells. Our results suggest a potential ceRNA regulatory network involving H19 regulates FOXM1 expression by competitively binding endogenous miR-342-3p in GBC.

Levels of a lincRNA encoded by a gene located next to POU3F3 (linc-POU3F3) were significantly higher in ESCC than neighboring nontumor tissues. In RNA immunoprecipitation assays, linc-POU3F3 was associated with the EZH2 messenger RNA (mRNA). Overexpression of linc-POU3F3 in cell lines increased their proliferation and ability to form colonies, and reduced the expression of POU3F3 mRNA, whereas knockdown of linc-POU3F3 increased the levels of POU3F3 mRNA. CpG islands in POU3F3 were densely hypermethylated in cell lines that overexpressed linc-POU3F3; methylation at these sites was reduced by knockdown of linc-POU3F3. Pharmacologic inhibition of EZH2 increased the levels of POU3F3 mRNA and significantly reduced binding of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B to POU3F3. Levels of linc-POU3F3 are increased in ESCC samples from patients compared with nontumor tissues. This noncoding RNA contributes to the development of ESCC by interacting with EZH2 to promote methylation of POU3F3, which encodes a transcription factor.	24631494	RID02209	epigenetic regulation

Using a blocking antibody, HGF/SF was identified as the fibroblast-derived growth factor capable of inducing H19 expression and cell morphogenesis. We further demonstrated that H19 promoter activity was stimulated by various growth factors using transient transfection in MDCK epithelial cells. HGF/SF was more efficient than EGF or FGF-2 in transactivating the H19 promoter, whereas IGF-2, TGFbeta-1, and TNF-alpha were ineffective. This activation by HGF/SF was prevented by pharmacological inhibition of MAP kinase or of phospholipase C. We conclude that H19 is a target gene for HGF/SF, a known regulator of epithelial/mesenchymal interactions, and suggest that the up-regulation of H19 may be implicated in morphogenesis and/or migration of epithelial cells.	11969291	RID02218	transcriptional regulation

In the present study, we first showed that miR-200c levels were higher in most EEC specimens than in non-tumor tissues, while MALAT1 levels were lower. Moreover, we found that miR-200c bound directly to MALAT1 using luciferase reporter and qRT-PCR assays. MALAT1 and miR-200c are reciprocally repressed, and TGF-beta increased MALAT1 expression by inhibiting miR-200c. When the interaction between miR-200c/MALAT1 was interrupted, the invasive capacity of EEC cells was decreased and EMT markers expression were altered in vitro. In summary, miR-200c/MALAT1 axis is a target with therapeutic potential in EEC.	27693631	RID02223	ceRNA or sponge

Prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3), also known as differential display code 3 (DD3), is one such lncRNA that maps to chromosome 9q21-22. PCA3 expression is highly specific to PCa. Here, we demonstrated that binding of Snail to the promoter region of PCA3 could activate the expression of PCA3. Down-regulation of PCA3 by silencing could increase the expression of the miRNA-1261, which then targeted at the PRKD3 gene (protein kinase D3) through competitive sponging. In summary, these results suggest that the transcription factor, Snail, activated the expression of lncRNA PCA3, which could inhibit the translation of PRKD3 protein via competitive miR-1261 sponging, and thus high expression of PRKD3 further promoted invasion and migration of prostate cancer.	27743381	RID02224	ceRNA or sponge

We found that lncRNA-PRAL could inhibit HCC growth and induce apoptosis in vivo and in vitro through p53. Subsequent investigations indicated that the three stem-loop motifs at the 5' end of lncRNA-PRAL facilitated the combination of HSP90 and p53 and thus competitively inhibited MDM2-dependent p53 ubiquitination, resulting in enhanced p53 stability.	26663434	RID02230	interact with protein

A different module of APTR associates with and recruits the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to epigenetically repress the p21 promoter. A decrease in APTR is necessary for the induction of p21 after heat stress and DNA damage by doxorubicin, and the levels of APTR and p21 are anti-correlated in human glioblastomas. Our data identify a new regulator of the cell-cycle inhibitor CDKN1A/p21 that acts as a proliferative factor in cancer cell lines and in glioblastomas and demonstrate that Alu elements present in lncRNAs can contribute to targeting regulatory lncRNAs to promoters.	24748121	RID02294	epigenetic regulation

We found an inverse relation between p15 antisense (p15AS) and p15 sense expression in leukaemia. A p15AS expression construct induced p15 silencing in cis and in trans through heterochromatin formation but not DNA methylation; the silencing persisted after p15AS was turned off, although methylation and heterochromatin inhibitors reversed this process. The p15AS-induced silencing was Dicer-independent. Expression of exogenous p15AS in mouse embryonic stem cells caused p15 silencing and increased growth, through heterochromatin formation, as well as DNA methylation after differentiation of the embryonic stem cells.	18185590	RID02304	epigenetic regulation

DACOR1 induction resulted in down-regulation of Cystathionine beta-synthase, which is known to lead to increased levels of S-adenosyl methionine-the key methyl donor for DNA methylation. Induction of DACOR1 in colon cancer cell lines significantly reduced their ability to form colonies in vitro, suggesting a growth suppressor function.	26307088	RID02322	epigenetic regulation

Here, we report that the lncRNA FER1L4 (fer-1-like family member 4, pseudogene) acts as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to regulate the expression of PTEN (a well-known tumor suppressor gene) by taking up miR-106a-5p in gastric cancer. We observed that FER1L4 was downregulated in gastric cancer and that its level corresponded with that of PTEN mRNA. Both FER1L4 and PTEN mRNA were targets of miR-106a-5p. Further experiments demonstrated that FER1L4 downregulation liberates miR-106a-5p and decreases the abundances of PTEN mRNA and protein. FER1L4 downregulation accelerated cell proliferation by promoting the G0/G1 to S phase transition.	26306906	RID02323	ceRNA or sponge

In this study, we found that cervical carcinoma high-expressed lncRNA 1 (lncRNA-CCHE1) was significantly upregulated in cervical cancer tissues.By contrast, the depletion of CCHE1 inhibits the proliferation of cervical cancer cells. RNA pull-down assays confirmed that CCHE1 physically associates with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) messenger RNA, consequently enhances the expression of PCNA.The expression of CCHE1 and PCNA is significantly correlated in cervical cancer tissues. The depletion of PCNA abolishes the effects of CCHE1 on the proliferation of cervical cancer cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that CCHE1 plays a pivotal role in cervical cancer cell proliferation via increasing PCNA expression and serves as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in human cervical cancer.	25921283	RID02333	interact with mRNA

We determined that the ENST00000480739 expression level was remarkably decreased in tumorous tissues compared with their corresponding non-tumorous tissues. Besides, enforced expression of ENST00000480739 suppressed PDAC cells' invasion in vitro. Overexpression of ENST00000480739 significantly increased both mRNA and protein levels of OS-9, and the luciferase assays confirmed that ENST00000480739 positively regulates OS-9 by activating the transcription level of the OS-9 promoter. We further found that ENST00000480739 may target hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) expression by upregulating OS-9.	25314054	RID02344	transcriptional regulation

Notably elevated FOXCUT and FOXC1 expression levels were observed in cancerous tissues compared to adjacent noncancerous tissues the expression of FOXCUT was positively correlated with expression of FOXC1 in ESCC specimens.Assays in vitro demonstrated that knockdown of either FOXCUT or FOXC1 remarkably inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion in ESCC cells. In conclusion, FOXCUT may be functionally involved in the tumor progression and survival of ESCC patients, at least in part, by modulating FOXC1. FOXCUT and FOXC1 may function as a lncRNA-mRNA gene pair, which may represent a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for ESCC patients.	25031703	RID02351	expression association

GAS5 lncRNA promoted the apoptosis of triple-negative and oestrogen receptor-positive cells but only dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition was able to enhance GAS5 levels in all cell types.

This lncRNA plays a role in MYC transcriptional regulation and promotes long-range chromatin looping. Importantly, the CCAT1-L locus is located within a strong super-enhancer and is spatially close to MYC. Knockdown of CCAT1-L reduced long-range interactions between the MYC promoter and its enhancers. In cis overexpression of CCAT1-L enhances MYC expression and promotes tumorigenesis.	24662484	RID02355	chromatin looping

RNA pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that GHET1 physically associates with insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) and enhances the physical interaction between c-Myc mRNA and IGF2BP1, consequently increasing the stability of c-Myc mRNA and expression. The expression of GHET1 and c-Myc is strongly correlated in gastric carcinoma tissues. these findings indicate that GHET1 plays a pivotal role in gastric carcinoma cell proliferation via increasing c-Myc mRNA stability and expression, which suggests potential use of GHET1 for the prognosis and treatment of gastric carcinoma.	24397586	RID02356	interact with mRNA

Mature miR-15a/miR-16-1 are produced in a Drosha-dependent process from DLEU2 and binding of the Myc oncoprotein to two alterative DLEU2 promoters represses both the host gene transcript and levels of mature miR-15a/miR-16-1. We additionally show that DLEU2 negatively regulates the G1 Cyclins E1 and D1 through miR-15a/miR-16-1 and provide evidence that these oncoproteins are subject to miR-15a/miR-16-1-mediated repression under normal conditions. We also demonstrate that DLEU2 overexpression blocks cellular proliferation and inhibits the colony-forming ability of tumor cell lines in a miR-15a/miR-16-1-dependent way.	19591824	RID02367	expression association

The GAS5 gene has no significant protein-coding potential but expression encodes small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) in its introns. Taken together with the recent demonstration of tumor suppressor characteristics in the related snoRNA U50, our observations suggest that such snoRNAs form a novel family of genes controlling oncogenesis and sensitivity to therapy in cancer.	18836484	RID02368	expression association

Here, we report HOTAIR as an androgen-repressed lncRNA, and, as such, it is markedly upregulated following androgen deprivation therapies and in CRPC. We further demonstrate a distinct mode of lncRNA-mediated gene regulation, wherein HOTAIR binds to the AR protein to block its interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2, thereby preventing AR ubiquitination and protein degradation. Consequently, HOTAIR expression is sufficient to induce androgen-independent AR activation and drive the AR-mediated transcriptional program in the absence of androgen. Functionally, HOTAIR overexpression increases, whereas HOTAIR knockdown decreases, prostate cancer cell growth and invasion.	26411689;25895025;28082728	RID02372	interact with protein

In this study, we report that HOTAIR (HOX antisense intergenic RNA) is upregulated in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer tissues compared to their primary counterparts. Mechanistically, HOTAIR is a direct target of ER-mediated transcriptional repression and is thus restored upon the blockade of ER signaling, either by hormone deprivation or by tamoxifen treatment. In conclusion, the long non-coding RNA HOTAIR is directly repressed by ER and its upregulation promotes ligand-independent ER activities and contributes to tamoxifen resistance. Further, chromosome conformation capture (3C) experiment demonstrated estrogen-induced DNA looping between the transcription start site (TSS) of the HOTAIR gene (anchor primer- AP) and the ER-bound enhancer (P4). HOTAIR directly interacts with ER and enhances ER transcriptional activities.	26364613;23375982	RID02373	chromatin looping;interact with protein

Therefore, it was concluded that HOTAIR overexpression might also get involved in tumor escape mechanisms, involving HLA-G upregulation via inhibiting miR-152.

BCAR4 expression correlates with advanced breast cancers, and therapeutic delivery of locked nucleic acids (LNAs) targeting BCAR4 strongly suppresses breast cancer metastasis in mouse models.

The acetylated H3K18 can be further recognized by PNUTS, which is recruited to the promoters of GLI2 target genes by BCAR4, to attenuate the protein's inhibitory effect on the enzymatic activity of PP1, leading to hypophosphorylation of RNA polymerase II at Ser5.	25416949	RID02382	interact with protein

Enforced expression of HOTAIR in epithelial cancer cells induced genome-wide re-targeting of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) to an occupancy pattern more resembling embryonic fibroblasts, leading to altered histone H3 lysine 27 methylation, gene expression, and increased cancer invasiveness and metastasis in a manner dependent on PRC2. We transduced vector- or HOTAIR-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells with short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting PRC2 subunits EZH2 or SUZ12. Immunoblot analyses confirmed efficient depletion of the targeted proteins (Fig. 4a). Depletion of either SUZ12 or EZH2 had little impact on the invasiveness of control cells, but completely reversed the ability of HOTAIR to promote matrix invasion (Fig. 4b). These results suggest that PRC2 is specifically required for HOTAIR to promote cellular invasiveness.Therapeutic targeting using tumor specific peptides inhibits long non-coding RNA HOTAIR activity in ovarian and breast cancer. In the current study, we describe a peptide nucleic acids (PNA)-based approach to block the ability of HOTAIR to interact with EZH2 and subsequently inhibit HOTAIR-EZH2 activity and resensitize resistant ovarian tumors to platinum. Treatment of HOTAIR-overexpressing ovarian and breast cancer cell lines with PNAs decreased invasion and increased chemotherapy sensitivity. Furthermore, the mechanism of action correlated with reduced nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) activation and decreased expression of NF-kB target genes matrix metalloprotease 9 and interleukin 6.	20393566;28420874;30048163	RID02387	interact with protein

We confirmed that the HBXIP expression correlated with expression of the c-Myc target genes cyclin A, eIF4E, and LDHA. RNAi-mediated silencing of HBXIP abolished c-Myc-mediated upregulation of these target genes. Mechanistically, HBXIP interacted directly with c-Myc through the leucine zippers and recruited the lncRNA Hotair along with the histone demethylase LSD1, for which Hotair serves as a scaffold. Silencing of HBXIP, Hotair, or LSD1 was sufficient to block c-Myc-enhanced cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our results support a model in which the HBXIP/Hotair/LSD1 complex serves as a critical effector of c-Myc in activating transcription of its target genes, illuminating long-standing questions on how c-Myc drives carcinogenesis.	26719542	RID02408	interact with protein

Meanwhile, our data also indicated that the function of LNMICC could be suppressed by miR-190 via directly targeting the miRNA-binding site in cervical cancer cells.	29229603;30134946	RID02469	ceRNA or sponge

We found that TUG1 is upregulated in ICC samples, which correlates with poor prognosis and adverse clinical pathological characteristics. When we explored the mechanisms underlying these effects, we found that TUG1 acts as an endogenous competing RNA (ceRNA) that sponges miR-145, thereby preventing the degradation of Sirt3 mRNA and increasing expression of Sirt3 and GDH proteins. In view of the above results, we used the TargetScan algorithm to find out whether glutaminase (GLS), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), and/or their regulators are targets of miR-145. Results revealed Sirt3, a positive regulator of GDH [21], and glutaminase 1 (GLS1) as potential targets of miR-145 (Figure 7A). Transfection experiments showed that ectopic expression of miR-145 significantly reduced Sirt3 and GDH, but not GLS1 protein levels (Figure 7B). To confirm that Sirt3 is a direct target of miR-145, the full length 3-UTR fragments of Sirt3 and corresponding mutant counterparts were cloned directly downstream of the firefly luciferase gene.	29371936	RID02470	ceRNA or sponge

Further validation confirmed that CDKN1A expression levels were increased in ECA-109 cells following SBF2-AS1 silencing. The results of the present study demonstrate that SBF2-AS1 is significantly upregulated in ESCC, and that silencing of SBF2-AS1 inhibits the proliferative and invasive ability of ESCC cells.

Patients with high LUCAT1 expression had significantly lower survival rates than patients with low LUCAT1 expression. Our results thus suggest that LUCAT1 regulates the stability of DNMT1 and inhibits the expression of tumor suppressors through DNA methylation, leading to the formation and metastasis of ESCC.

Mutant p53 and ID4 delocalize MALAT1 from nuclear speckles and favor its association with chromatin. This enables aberrant recruitment of MALAT1 on VEGFA pre-mRNA and modulation of VEGFA isoforms expression. Interestingly, VEGFA-dependent expression signatures associate with ID4 expression specifically in basal-like breast cancers carrying TP53 mutations. Our results highlight a key role for MALAT1 in control of VEGFA isoforms expression in breast cancer cells expressing gain-of-function mutant p53 and ID4 proteins.In BC cells, oncogenic splicing factor SRSF1 bridges MALAT1 to mutant p53 and ID4 proteins, favoring its chromatin association and thus inducing the expression of various VEGF-A isoforms, indicating a role of MALAT1 in the promotion of angiogenesis	28652379;30349115	RID02516	interact with mRNA

Furthermore, the results found that the expression level of IGF2 was positively correlated with DANCR expression in ovarian cancer tissues.

Here we report that chromobox 7 (CBX7) within the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 binds to ANRIL, and both CBX7 and ANRIL are found at elevated levels in prostate cancer tissues. In concert with H3K27me recognition, binding to RNA contributes to CBX7 function and disruption of either interaction impacts the ability of CBX7 to repress the INK4b/ARF/INK4a locus and control senescence. Structure-guided analysis reveals the molecular interplay between non-coding RNA and H3K27me as mediated by the conserved chromodomain. Our study suggests a new mechanism by which non-coding RNA participates directly in epigenetic transcriptional repression.

Schematic model illustrating molecular interplay between methylated H3K27 (by EZH2 of PRC2) and ncRNA transcripts ANRIL for silencing of the INK4b/ARF/INK4a locus by Polycomb CBX7. Both PRC1 and PRC2 complexes are retained at a repression site of a target gene through their association with the nascent ANRIL transcripts of Pol II. Note that the stem loop RNA structure is used for illustration only; RNA/CBX7 binding could result in dissociation of PRC1 from H3K27me, leading to a reversal of transcriptional repression of the target gene.	20541999;21828241	RID02550	interact with protein

In the present study, we discovered that nickel exposure led to MEG3 downregulation through its promoter hypermethylation, and MEG3 downregulation resulted in PHLPP1 transcriptional inhibition, consequently leading to HIF-1a protein translation elevation, and in turn promoting malignant transformation of human bronchial epithelial cells. Mechanistically, MEG3 downregulation was attributed to nickel-induced promoter hypermethylation via elevating DNMT3b expression, whereas PHLPP1 transcriptional inhibition was due to the decreasing interaction of MEG3 with its inhibitory transcription factor c-Jun. Moreover, HIF-1a protein translation was upregulated via activating the Akt/p70S6K/S6 axis resultant from PHLPP1 inhibition in nickel responses. Collectively, we uncover that nickel exposure results in DNMT3b induction and MEG3 promoter hypermethylation and expression inhibition, further reduces its binding to c-Jun and in turn increasing c-Jun inhibition of PHLPP1 transcription, leading to the Akt/p70S6K/S6 axis activation, and HIF-1a protein translation, as well as malignant transformation of human bronchial epithelial cells.	28263966	RID02563	expression association

Here we report, for the first time, that HOST2 promotes tumor cell migration, invasion and proliferation in epithelial ovarian cancer by working in key aspects of biological behaviors. In the present study, bioinformatics analysis indicated that HOST2 binds with microRNA let-7b, a potent tumor suppressor, which was then verified to target HOST2. Our results showed that HOST2 harbors a let-7b binding site and modulates let-7b availability by acting as a molecular sponge. HOST2 inhibits let-7b functions, which post-transcriptionally suppress the expression of targets, including some oncogenes that regulate cell growth and motility. Additionally, understanding HOST2/let-7b-dependent regulation may lead to alternative approaches for the diagnosis and cure of this deadly disease.	25292198	RID02570	ceRNA or sponge

We demonstrate that ectopic expression of HOTAIR induces NF-kB activation during DDR and interleukin-6 and interleukin-6 expression, both key NF-kB target genes. We show that HOTAIR regulates activation of NF-kB by decreasing Ik-Ba (NF-kB inhibitor) and establish that by inducing prolonged NF-kB activation and expression of NF-kB target genes during DNA damage, HOTAIR has a critical role in cellular senescence and platinum sensitivity. Our findings suggest that an NF-kB-HOTAIR axis drives a positive-feedback loop cascade during DDR and contributes to cellular senescence and chemotherapy resistance in ovarian and other cancers.In response to DNA damage, we found that NF-kB directly upregulates HOTAIR expression in OC cell lines. Downregulation of Ik-Ba during DDR induced a NF-kB-HOTAIR signaling positive-feedback loop cascade, and we demonstrate that DDR further induces HOTAIR-mediated expression of p65-NF-kB and NF-kB target genes MMP9 and IL-6 to promote OC cellular senescence and resistance to DNA-damaging agents. Collectively, these results are the first to demonstrate a role for HOTAIR in DNA damage-induced NF-kB signaling pathway.	27041570;28420874	RID02591	expression association

In addition, ectopic expression of MEG3 suppressed the proliferation and growth of OVCAR3 cells and promoted apoptosis. Finally, MEG3 activated p53 in OVCAR3 cells. In conclusion, our data suggest that MEG3 is epigenetically silenced in EOC due to promoter hypermethylation, which may contribute to the development of EOC.In vitro study indicated that over-expression of MEG3 in OVCAR3 cells inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis by promoting p53, GDF15 and RB1 expression	24859196	RID02594	expression association

Of note, Mechanistic investigations found that down-regulation of Xist might increase the expression level of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) and block Taxol-induced apoptosis to cause resistance phenotype, suggesting that Xist may be a potential marker for chemotherapeutic responses in ovarian cancer.Down-regulated expression of XIAP has been shown to induce apoptosis in chemoresistant human ovarian cancer cells (24). Down-regulation of XIST might increase the expression level of XIAP and block drug-induced apoptosis to cause resistance phenotype.	12492109	RID02598	expression association

Gene expression profiling revealed as part of the transcriptomic changes induced by PCDH10 a reduction in levels of MALAT1, a long noncoding RNA, that mediated tumor suppression functions of PCDH10 in EEC cells. We found that MALAT1 transcription was regulated by Wnt/beta-catenin signaling via TCF promoter binding and PCDH10 decreased MALAT1 by modulating this pathway.	25085246	RID02617	expression association

HOTAIR knockdown dramatically inhibited cell viability and induced G1-phase arrest by promoting miR-218 expression. VOPP1 was shown to be a functional target of miR-218, and the main downstream signaling, NF-kB, was inactivated by HOTAIR through the suppression of miR-218 expression. Additionally, HOTAIR knockdown partially reversed 5FU resistance through promoting miR-218 and inactivating NF-kB signaling. Furthermore, HOTAIR restrained 5FU-induced cytotoxicity on CRC cells through promotion of thymidylate synthase expression.

We demonstrate that ectopic expression of HOTAIR induces NF-kB activation during DDR and interleukin-6 and interleukin-6 expression, both key NF-kB target genes. We show that HOTAIR regulates activation of NF-kB by decreasing Ik-Ba (NF-kB inhibitor) and establish that by inducing prolonged NF-kB activation and expression of NF-kB target genes during DNA damage, HOTAIR has a critical role in cellular senescence and platinum sensitivity. Our findings suggest that an NF-kB-HOTAIR axis drives a positive-feedback loop cascade during DDR and contributes to cellular senescence and chemotherapy resistance in ovarian and other cancers.In response to DNA damage, we found that NF-kB directly upregulates HOTAIR expression in OC cell lines. Downregulation of Ik-Ba during DDR induced a NF-kB-HOTAIR signaling positive-feedback loop cascade, and we demonstrate that DDR further induces HOTAIR-mediated expression of p65-NF-kB and NF-kB target genes MMP9 and IL-6 to promote OC cellular senescence and resistance to DNA-damaging agents.

The microarray analysis identified a novel lncRNA termed metastatic renal cell carcinoma-associated transcript 1 (MRCCAT1), which is highly expressed in metastatic ccRCC tissues and associated with the metastatic properties of ccRCC. Mechanistically, MRCCAT1 represses NPR3 transcription by recruiting PRC2 to NPR3 promoter, and subsequently activates p38-MAPK signaling pathway.To test this, we performed RIP assay with an antibody against EZH2 (an important subunit of the PRC2 complex), and found a significant enrichment of MRCCAT1 with EZH2, compared with IgG control.	28659173	RID02734	interact with protein

ANRASSF1 ectopic overexpression reduces RASSF1A abundance and increases the proliferation of HeLa cells, whereas ANRASSF1 silencing causes the opposite effects. ANRASSF1 overexpression causes a marked increase in both PRC2 occupancy and histone H3K27me3 repressive marks, specifically at the RASSF1A promoter region.We demonstrated that ANRASSF1 formed an lncRNA/DNA hybrid, which mediated the recruitment of SUZ12, a member of PRC2, to the RASSF1A promoter.	23990798	RID02742	interact with protein

High HOTAIR expression is correlated with tumor stage and poor prognosis. we demonstrated that HOTAIR induced DNA methylation of miR-454-3p by recruiting EZH2 and DNMT1 to the miR-454-3p promoter regions, which markedly silences miR-454-3p expression. HOTAIR knockdown leads to growth inhibition of human chondrosarcoma cells in vitro and in vivo.Further analysis revealed that STAT3 and ATG12 are targets of miR-454-3p, initiate HOTAIR deficiency-induced apoptosis and reduce autophagy.	28182000	RID02787	interact with protein

We found that aberrant upregulation intranuclear Linc00441 was reversely correlated with RB1 expression in human HCC samples. Furthermore, RNA pull-down assay indicated the decreased level of RB1 induced by Linc00441 was associated with the incidental methylation by DNMT3A recruited by Linc00441. The gain- and loss-of-function investigation revealed that Linc00441 could promote the proliferation of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo with an apoptosis suppression and cell cycle rearrangement.	28300839	RID02788	interact with protein

Levels of a lincRNA encoded by a gene located next to POU3F3 (linc-POU3F3) were significantly higher in ESCC than neighboring nontumor tissues. In RNA immunoprecipitation assays, linc-POU3F3 was associated with the EZH2 messenger RNA (mRNA). Overexpression of linc-POU3F3 in cell lines increased their proliferation and ability to form colonies, and reduced the expression of POU3F3 mRNA, whereas knockdown of linc-POU3F3 increased the levels of POU3F3 mRNA. CpG islands in POU3F3 were densely hypermethylated in cell lines that overexpressed linc-POU3F3; methylation at these sites was reduced by knockdown of linc-POU3F3. Pharmacologic inhibition of EZH2 increased the levels of POU3F3 mRNA and significantly reduced binding of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B to POU3F3. Levels of linc-POU3F3 are increased in ESCC samples from patients compared with nontumor tissues. This noncoding RNA contributes to the development of ESCC by interacting with EZH2 to promote methylation of POU3F3, which encodes a transcription factor.	24631494	RID02794	interact with protein

Additionally, ChIP, RIP, RNA-pulldown and luciferase reporter assays evidenced that SNHG6 could epigenetically silenced p27 and could competitively sponging miR-101-3p thereby regulating zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1).In summary, our findings demonstrated that SNHG6 acted as an oncogene in gastric cancer cells through regulating miR-101-3p/ZEB1 at a post-transcriptional level and silencing expression at a transcriptional level by recruiting enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) to the promoter of p27.	28683446;30031062	RID02798	interact with protein

In the present study, we show that the expression level of the lncRNA ANRIL was elevated in HTLV-1-infected cell lines and clinical ATL samples. In addition, we observed that the ANRIL/EZH2 complex repressed p21/CDKN1A transcription through H3K27 trimethylation of the p21/CDKN1A promoter. Taken together, our results implicate that the lncRNA ANRIL, by cooperating with EZH2, supports the proliferation of HTLV-1-infected cells, which is thought to be critical for oncogenesis. In this study, we demonstrated that the lncRNA ANRIL was important for maintaining the proliferation of ATL cells in vitro and in vivo ANRIL was shown to activate NF-kB signaling through forming a ternary complex with EZH2 and p65. Furthermore, epigenetic inactivation of p21/CDKN1A was involved in the oncogenic function of ANRIL.	30258009	RID02800	interact with protein

Mechanistically, we found that increased HOTAIR expression inhibited the expression of the TRAIL receptor death receptor 5 (DR5), whereas HOTAIR knockdown increased DR5 expression. We further demonstrated that HOTAIR regulates DR5 expression via the epigenetic regulator enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and that EZH2 controls histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation on the DR5 gene. Taken together, these results demonstrate that high HOTAIR levels increase the resistance of pancreatic cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis via epigenetic regulation of DR5 expression.Some TRAIL and DR4/DR5 agonist antibodies, including conatumumab (AMG655, antibody for DR5) and tigatuzumab (CS-1008/TRA-8, antibody for DR5), have also been used for treating several types of cancers	28476883	RID02832	interact with protein

Silenced PVT1 significantly inhibited thyroid cell line IHH-4, FTC-133, and 8505C cell proliferation and arrested cell cycle at G0/G1 stage and significantly decreased cyclin D1 and TSHR expressions. Moreover, lncRNA PVT1 could be enriched by EZH2, and silencing PVT1 resulted in the decreased recruitment of EZH2. This study suggested that lncRNA PVT1 may contribute to tumorigenesis of thyroid cancer through recruiting EZH2 and regulating TSHR expression.	26427660	RID02839	interact with protein

In the present study, the high expression of lncRNA H19 was identified as a powerful factor associated with paclitaxel (PTX) resistance in ERalpha-positive breast cancer cells, but not in ERalpha-negative breast cancer cells. LncRNA H19 attenuated cell apoptosis in response to PTX treatment by inhibiting transcription of pro-apoptotic genes BIK and NOXA. H19 was further confirmed to suppress the promoter activity of BIK by recruiting EZH2 and by trimethylating the histone H3 at lysine 27. Interestingly, our data showed that lncRNA H19 was one of the downstream target molecules of ERalpha. Altered ERalpha expression may therefore change H19 levels to modulate the apoptosis response to chemotherapy in breast cancer cells. Our data suggest that the ERalpha-H19-BIK signaling axis plays an important role in promoting chemoresistance.	27845892	RID02842	interact with protein

Of the three lncRNAs (BANCR, PTCSC3, and NAMA), expression of BANCR was significantly up-regulated while PTCSC3 and NAMA were significantly down-regulated in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) compared to that in normal tissue. BANCR-knockdown also led to inhibition of cell growth and cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase through down-regulation of cyclin D1. In addition, BANCR was enriched by polycomb enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), and silencing BANCR led to decreased chromatin recruitment of EZH2, which resulted significantly reduced expression of TSHR. These findings indicate that BANCR may contribute to the tumorigenesis of PTC through regulation of cyclin D1 and TSHR.	26323637	RID02843	interact with protein

We termed it as EZH2-binding lncRNA in cervical cancer [lncRNA-EBIC]. We also found that the association between lncRNA-EBIC and EZH2 was required for the repression of E-cadherin, which was a key molecular in the metastasis of cervical cancer. Conclusion: These results demonstrated that lncRNA-EBIC was an oncogenic lncRNA, which could promote tumor cell invasion in CC by binding to EZH2 and inhibiting E-cadherin expression.	25007342	RID02844	interact with protein
